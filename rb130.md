## Blocks
### Closures in Ruby
* "Chunks of code" saved and executed at a later time.
* 3 ways to work w/ closures:
  1. Instantiating an object from the `Proc` class
  2. Using blocks
  3. Using lambdas
* They're **binding** in that they retain references to their surrounding *artifacts* (i.e. variables, methods, objects, etc)


### Writing Methods w/ Blocks
* In Ruby, every method can take an optional block as an **implicit** argument.

#### Yielding
It lets us invoke our passed in block argument from within the method
* wrap in a conditional using `Kernel#block_given?` to allow method w/ `yield` to be invoked with or without a block (i.e. without raising a `LoadJumpError`)
* **Use case:** `Yield` allows future developers to inject additional code in our method without modifying the method implementation.

#### Passing Execution to the Block
